	    	<p>It seems like everyone is touting the benefits of using a recall system. But you know what? These systems are focusing on the <strong>wrong</strong> times for patient marketing. <br> You end up <strong>churning</strong> patients.</p>
            <p>Where's all the data they are using to make good decisions about when to market to your patients and which media source work best?</p>
            <p>If everyone is recommending exams once a year and sending out recall then why does it take two and a half years for the patient to come back?</p>
            <h2><strong>Current recall systems don't work!</strong></h2>
            <p><strong>It's hard to run your own in house recall program because there are multiple reports that must be compiled to know who needs to be contacted and when. Then you have to rely on staff to consistently run these reports and send out the marketing materials. And who even know if it's working if your only tracking the number of patients that respond, there's missing data here.</strong></p>
            <p>So what do you do? You end up using recall software thinking that it's taking care of recall and forget about.</p>
