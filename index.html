	    	<p>It seems like everyone is touting the benefits of using a Practice Management System and going "paperless". But you know what? It's hard to stay efficient when you are clicking through tons of screens and promtps. You end up not even using most of the features in the software, it's just bloated.</p>
            <p>It feels like the only way to manage this bahemoth systems is too hire more staff and pay them to just sit there and enter information into a computer all day. Talk about killing efficiency and profits!</p>
            <p><strong>It's hard to be efficient because there are so many cumbersome steps and clicks between the patients visits and the management software's record keeping process.</strong></p>
            <p>So what do you do? You end up using the software for only a couple of features and excel or paper for everything else.</p>

                <li><strong>You can't find someones order.</strong>Ever had to tell a patient you can't find their order? Someone forgot to put that into the bloated software, why? See the above. ^^ </li> 
                <li><strong>Bloated Software doesn't track phone calls.</strong> You can't track what staff told your patients and end up looking foolish. "Doesn't anybody know what going on around here?" <strong>~Angry Patient</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Paper piles up and takes over office.</strong> You should be able to easily scan, categoize, and find documents in your bloated software.
